## Project

### What is a project

A temporary endeavor to create a unique product, service, or outcome. It should introduce **changes to org**, have a **start to end**, being **cross-functional**, **unique**, and **not free(anymeans)**.

### Why use a project

1. Strategic alignment of key activities and visibility at appropriate level.

2. Priorities activities.

3. Deliver change in a structured and organized manner.

4. Effective and efficient management of organization's limited resources.

5. Establish ownership and accountability.

6. Provides clarity across what will be done, when, who, why, and the outcome.

## Project Management Overall

### What is project management

Planning, delegating, monitoring, and controlling of all aspects of a project; and motivating **those** involved in the project to achieve objective within limited **time, cost, quality, scope, benefits, and risks**.

> Working on project, manipulating people, to achieve objectives, using limited resources.

Its valuable because:

- Resource is limited

- Risk needs to be managed

- Issues persists

- Changes need to be made

- Knowledge needs to be obtained

- Experience should be obtained

### Project Manager

Key features:

![Project Manager](./prjmgt/pmanager.svg)

> Strong knowledge worker who knows how to manipulate people, inspire them, and targeted on achieving project objectives.

What project manager do:

![Project Manager Do](./prjmgt/pmanagerdo.svg)

> Project manager needs to **Plan** -> **Organize** -> **Lead** -> **Control** the project from start to end.

### Scrum Master

**Command & Control** -> **Servant Leadership**

![Servant Leadership](./prjmgt/smasterlead.svg)

> Works is distributed to team members who deems fit the job. Scrum master doesn't have to be all power, but know when to give permission.

### Project Managing Process and SDLCs

> PRINCE2 & PMBOK are PMP; Agile and Formal are set of SDLCs.

| PRINCE2 | PMBOK |
| :-: | :-: |
| Gov Backed | Useful standard |
| Widely used & accepted - Consulting, Private, Gov | Plan future in details |
| Process oriented | Substantial & detailed framework |
| Project -> Stages | Rigorous Control |
| Detailed & Thorough | Clearly defined roles |
| Clear need, target customer, realistic benefit, thorough analysis |  Clear and validated deliverables |

> PRINCE2 is overall better (No args accepted). 

PRINCE2 has extensive documentation which is helpful with corporate planning and tracking.

PMBOK has extensive tools, techniques, and supporting template to manage, monitor, and control.

---

| Agile | Formal |
| :-: | :-: |
| Adaptive | Little ALT |
| Constant FB | Req defined at first |
| CI/CD | Sequentially complete task |
| Involvement & Ownership across whole team | PM is the boss |
| Team self select jobs | PM assigned jobs |
| Small actions (Sprint/Scrum/Tasks) | Used in Large SW |
| Customer focus and interactive | Traditional > 40Ys |

> Agile is more flexible, fits CI/CD, increase PRJ success rate of 6%.

Formal methods has extensive planning, accurate timeline & budget. (Better estimation) Difficult on **roll back**

Agile is flexible, better engaged, but difficult without SM, hard to apply on large PRJ.

### How to success

60% chances by looking at: **executive sponsorship** (positive related to PM effort), **emotional maturity** (are people experienced),  **User Involvement** (Agile related), **Optimization** (Requirement states).

Outsource to professionals; using mature architecture; using agile; PM is good; ... (Honestly, the rest is redudant)


## Project Initiation

### Project Screening

Idea to project:

![Project Screening](./prjmgt/prjscreen.svg)

### Business Case

**Case study**(Bz needs) -> **Contraint Study**(Scope, time, cost) -> **Develop Business Case** -> **Project Charter**(Simple display)

![Business Case Components](./prjmgt/bzcase.svg)

> For bosses to know if the project worth taking; how it adds value to the org; matching predefined org characteristics; focus on benefit/investment; document throughout the project.

---

> Non-mandatory (non-volunteering) projects need to make money primarily.

**Return On Investment** : (TD Benefit - TD Cost) / TD Cost \* Total Discounted: a ratio, by AU gov, 4%-10%, avg. 7%.

**Net Present Value** : Net Monetary gain/loss over all future discounted cost and benefit (No idea what it is).

**Payback Period** : How long before benefit > cost, and payback recover initial cost.

**Rough Order of Magnitude** : Estimation increase by time, initially 25% margin plus minus (Cone of Uncertainty).

## Project Planning

Project Planning is composed by **Project Management Plan** and **SDLC**.

### What is Project Management & SDLC

Project management is a process which defines a series of tasks (**Planning** -> **Executing** -> **Controlling**) to deliver an outcome.

SDLC (**Systems** Development Life Cycle) is a process of **Planning** -> **Creating** -> **Testing** -> **Deploying** an Info System.

> A process is a series of progressive and interdependent steps by which an end is attained.

### Project Management Plan

> No unified standard of PMP must be followed, the standard varies but the goal shared.

PMP is a formal document on how the project should be **executed** -> **monitored** -> **controlled**, fully managed by *Project Manager*, providing details and holding truth.

> PC is short/summarized, PMP is formal and detailed. (PC shows why to do a project/PMP shows how)

---

![PMP components](./prjmgt/pmp.svg)

Additionally, PMP should contains:

- Roles/Responsibilities

- Mandatory Project Planning:
	- Schedule
	- Risk Management
	- Cost Estimation
	- QA
	- CM

PMP is **large**, multiple *expert* would coporate on prepraing details, *PM* coordinates, in charge, and take the accountability for **quality** and **outcome**.

### SDLC

SDLC would be selected in **Project Planning** but execute in **Execution Phase**.

![SDLC Components](./prjmgt/sdlc.svg)

> The process of **implementation** -> **integration** -> **testing** -> **deployment** often in cycles, considered as CI/CD.

#### Formal Methods

Waterfall:

- simple to apply

- easy to manage

- phases are processed sequentially

- documentation is rich

- for requirements are very well understood and stable

BUT:

- not adaptive to changes (Incremental is better)

- sequentially processed phase tasks

- requirements must be clear

- client approval at the very end

- difficult to integrate risk management

---

Incremental is **multi-waterfall**, it can **early/fast release** operational product, **adaptive** to changes, **FB** is enabled to client for each build, and **easier for testing**; however, it requires **more resources**, **management attention**, increments are hard to **partition**, phases are still sequential, **integration issue**.

---

V-model is **continuous-testing-waterfall**, easy to use, has clear **phase objectives**, early testing increase success rate, works well for small PRJ; however, it is still sequential, not adaptive, no early deliverables, no problem handle mechanism.

### Agile Methods

> Changes are getting faster, customer needs result in CI/CD, entry barriers getting lower increases competition, cross-functional team fill in personal inability, QA is essential.

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools; Working software over comprehensive documentation; Customer collaboration over contract negotiation; Responding to change over following a plan.

![Agile Manifesto](./prjmgt/agilemanifesto.svg)

---

Agile is a collection of **SDLCs** (Methodologies), for **CI/CD** with **evolving requirements**, it encourage **adaptive** for changing, **teamwork** as well as **self-organizing**, aims to make fast and continuous delivery with QA.

> 12 principles are important (<s>but useless</s>): agile satisfy customer with early, constant, and frequent delivery of working software, everyone working together in a motivated and self-organized manner with regular self-reflection, adapting changes for competitiveness, and keep the project sustainable with technical excellance while remaining simplicity.  

#### SDLCs

Kanban is a visualized tracking of working items which are **TO-DO**, **DOING**, and **DONE**.

![Kanban Sample by Trello](./prjmgt/kanban.png)

---

Scrum is a light weight and simple framework to address complex adaptive problems, productively and creatively delivering products, it let team to maximize business value/time, ensures rapid inspection on product, let team determine the best way to deliver the most required features, and progress is visible.

![Scrum Key Characteristics](./prjmgt/scrumchars.svg)

Scrum has three major components:

![Scrum components](./prjmgt/scrumcomps.svg)

---

PO: boss, defines the features, decide time and contents, look after ROI, make decision based upon market value, accept or reject.

SM: team leader, who manage the project, apply scrum, remove impediments, ensure team functions, enable cooperation, and protect team.

Team: Cross functional, full time and colocated.

---

Sprint planning would generate the tasks to achieve in the sprint and the sprint backlog. (goal, time estimation, plan, high-level design)

Daily Scrum assigns tasks for each member in that day. (Did, do, impediments)

Sprint review focus on the progress review, demo.

Sprint retrospective views what is or isn't working, talk about **Start Doing**, **Stop Doing**, and **Keep Doing**.

---

User story describes requirement, story points is a measurement of difficulty on implementing this requirement, it helps evaluate how much work can be done in a sprint.

Product Backlog contains user stories, express the value of function to clients, selected by PO, re-evaluated at the beginning of each sprint.

Sprint Backlog contains lower level user stories, decomposed by the team from product backlog, remaining estimated items updated daily, either 100% done after the sprint or not done.

Burndown chart build upon the story points against days, graphic interpretation of work left vs. time.

#### Pros and Cons

Agile satisfy customer with rapid, continuous delivery, better people interaction, QA, and adaptiveness to changes; however, up front estimation is hard to make, and requires users' time investment, not easy for new starter, and could be intense for unexperienced team.
